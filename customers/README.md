# Customers Folder

This folder contains customer-specific data and configurations.

## Structure

Each customer has their own subfolder:

```
customers/
└── {customer_id}/
    ├── config/
    │   ├── branding.json
    │   ├── keywords.json
    │   └── feeds.json
    ├── customer_info.json
    ├── user_access.json
    └── data/
        ├── database.xlsx
        └── newsletters/
```

Customer folders are created automatically during the onboarding process.
